performance using the provided metrics.
Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
R-squared (RÂ²): Proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables.
